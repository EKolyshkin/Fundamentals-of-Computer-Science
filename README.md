# Fundamentals of Computer Science
Coursework for Fundamentals of Computer Science I & II (CS210 & CS211) at Bellevue College, Washington.


## Learning Outcomes:
- Solve computer programming problems using current industry standards in software engineering; editing, compiling, and executing code; which is structured in maintainable style with programmer comments (documentation).
- Define the concepts of data types, specifically the use of primitive data versus object, accessing and creating methods, their parameters passed, and returned.
- Use procedural decomposition to construct programming solutions using decision controls (if, else), repetitions (for, do while), and external file reading (secondary storage).
- Utilize simple data structures such as arrays and classes to solve complex problems, and use an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) to fix potential errors identified with code testing concepts.
- Create classes via inheritance, use their objects to demonstrate polymorphism of both interfaces and abstract classes; and explain the role of generic class templates within classes.
- Explain the principles of recursion versus repetition, and write recursive methods for a variety of tasks.
- Implement and contrast the uses of various data structures including arrays, sets, lists, collections, and trees.
- Recognize the use of Big-O notation to explain program performance in searching, sorting, recursion, and implementation of existing methods from a software API (Application Programming Interface).
- Compose programs that facilitate error handling using API standard Exceptions with try-catch blocks.
- Design programs using a Graphical User Interface (GUI) and event driven programming.
